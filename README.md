# Seventy5 attendance app

## Description

* Seventy5 is a college management application that allows students of MEC (Model Engineering College) to check their attendance, timetable and get personalized suggestions for bunking classes. 

* You can earn badges based on your attendance stats.

* Attendance and timetable are directly fetched from Ezygo college website

* The student details are stored once entered so there is no need to enter student details each time the app is opened.

* The app shows the number of classes a student can cut or have to attend in order to maintain the required minimum attendance.
